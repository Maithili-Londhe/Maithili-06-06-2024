        compile time or runtime exceptions/errors(problems).


=> why we use exception handling?

Answer: To maintain the normal flow a java program execution, we use exception handling
        concept.

=> how we implement exception handling in Java Programming?

Answer: in java programming we have certain blocks and keywords, which can help
        us to implement exception handling techniques.
        
        Blocks:
           - try
           - catch
           - finally
        
        Keywords:
        	- throws-We can declare multiple exceptions using throws keyword that can be thrown 
        	         by the method. For example, main() throws IOException, SQLException.
        	- throw-We are allowed to throw only one exception at 
        	   a time i.e. we cannot throw multiple exceptions.

=> where we use exception handling?

Answer: In case of arrays, strings, cloning, database connectivity, 
        io, threads...etc.

Note: The 'Throwable' class is the superclass of all Errors and Exceptions 
      in the Java language.
      
Error: An Error is a subclass of Throwable that indicates serious problems 
        that a reasonable application should not try to catch. 
        Most such errors are abnormal conditions.
        
Exception: The class Exception and its subclasses are a form of Throwable 
           that indicates conditions that a reasonable application 
           might want to catch.

Types of Java Exceptions
	- checked/compile time exceptions
		- The class Exception and any subclasses that are not also 
		  subclasses of "RuntimeException" are checked exceptions.
		  
	- unchecked/runtime exceptions
		- RuntimeException and its subclasses are unchecked exceptions.

** Custom Exceptions
